# Introduction 
This project combines SpecFlow, Selenium and the MSTest runner to exercise the Azure "Java Coffee Shop" application service.
# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references


# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

## Selenium WebDriver(s) 
You will need a minimum of 1 or more webdrivers depending on which web browsers you plan on testing.  The WebDriver has to be in the Windows Path statement so the Selenium runtime can find it and run it.  

Browser|Driver Name|Driver Download
---|---|---
IE 11|IEDriverServer.exe| (https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)
Chrome|ChromeDriver.exe|(https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)
FireFox|geckodriver.exe|(https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)


## Issues Noted

Internet Explorer will have to have **ALL** Security Zones set to protected.  See [Selenium WebDriver and IE11](http://www.michael-whelan.net/selenium-webdriver-and-ie11/)
